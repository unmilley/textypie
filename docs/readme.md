# Textypie

A brief description of what this project does and who it's for

## FAQ

#### Does Textypie collect data about me?

- The web application uses [umami](https://umami.is/) only for visit analytics and no other requests.
- The application at startup makes a request to [github](https://api.github.com/repos/unmilley/textypie/releases/latest) to see if there is a new version, and that's it.

#### Where can I find more scripts?

More features can be found in the [scripts directory](https://github.com/unmilley/textypie/tree/main/Scripts/customs). It contains scripts suggested by the community that are not in the built-in script library. You can find new features there or suggest your own!

#### Can I create my own scripts?

Sure! Just follow the instructions on the [Custom Scripts page](custom-scripts.md) to find out how to get started.

#### How can I report a problem?

The best way to do that is to [file an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/unmilley/textypie/issues/new).
